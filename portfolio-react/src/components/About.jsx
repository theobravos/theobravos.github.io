          <p>
            As a Master of Science in Business Analytics candidate at
            the University of Southern California, I specialize in
            financial data science, predictive modeling, and business
            intelligence. My experience includes an internship in sports
            analytics where I built models to improve forecasting accuracy
            and automated reporting for key decision-makers. A former NCAA D1
            football player, I bring a strong sense of teamwork and discipline to
            my goal of pursuing a full-time role in data analytics or financial analysis.
